Building Circuits
==============================

A primary goal of simpycirc is to provide an interface to easily define and simulate circuits. Writing verbose netlists (a la SPICE) is useful once a circuit has reached a sufficient level of complexity, but hardly necessary for simple circuits with fewer than five or so components.
